# Ambersteel TTRPG
**Ambersteel** is a table-top role-playing game (**TTRPG**), requiring a **game master** (**GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

On the spectrum of *narrative-driven*, *game-y* and *simulationist*, **Ambersteel** aims for the region between *game-y* and *narrative-driven*, while leaning heavily towards *game-y*:
* Combat is a risky affair and requires tactical and strategic thinking, or the readiness to retreat, when things go awry. When a character suffers **injuries**, they are in *serious trouble*. 
* Magic is a risky affair, with a chance for a spell to fail and back-fire. The chance of failure is manageable, however. 
* Players are expected to manage resources, such as their character's health and possessions. Character's are neither *damage sponges*, nor *item vacuums*. 
* **PC** change and roleplaying are embedded into the rules. There are no classes or other arbitrary restrictions on what a character can do. **Attributes** and **skills** improve as they are used, incentivising experimentation. Characters have long-term and short-term goals and beliefs, which drive them onward and which change over time. 
* Characters can help each other in game mechanical ways, encouraging co-operative play. 
* Generalist characters benefit from their varied knowledge, while specialists enjoy unique abilities. 
* **PC**s aren't expected to start powerful and skilled. But they're expected to become powerful and skilled over the course of a long campaign. 

While each player only controls a single character, the **GM** is in control of every single non-player character (**NPC**), the world and the story. A player character is abbreviated as **PC**. 

The system is designed to fit a low to medium fantasy medieval setting. 

The rules are designed to be as intuitive and simple as possible, while complex enough to allow players to make meaningful choices. 

Most rules will have a certain degree of vagueness to them. This is at least partially deliberate. The situations that can come up during play are simply too varied and numerous to be possible to completely cover with rules, without requiring epic tomes filled to the brim with highly specific rulings for highly specific situations. Instead, the game relies on the **GM** to arbitrate in every situation. The descriptions in the rules here should serve as a point of orientation for the **GM**. How they interpret the rules, is how they're to be understood. 

Despite the focus on tactical and deadly combat, this is not an *adversarial* game. The **GM** and the players work ***together*** to create a unique experience and weave a story of glorious triumph, tragic defeat or anything in-between. Ultimately, the **GM**'s job is to provide interesting conundrums to the players and their job is to provide interesting answers, in-line with what their characters believe. What's important to remember is that the **GM** is a *player*, too. They're here to have fun and enjoy their time at the table, too. That is why it's important to work ***together***.
